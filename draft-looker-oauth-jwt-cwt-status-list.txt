1.  Introduction

   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] and CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) [RFC8392]
   as secure token formats, have vast possible applications.  Some of
   these applications can involve issuing a token whereby certain
   semantics about the token can change over time, which are important
   to be able to communicate to relying parties in an interoperable
   manner, such as whether the token is considered invalidated or
   suspended by its issuer.

   This document defines Status List representations in JWT and CWT
   formats that describe the individual statuses of multiple Referenced
   Tokens, which themselves are also JWTs or CWTs.  The statuses of all
   Referenced Tokens are conveyed via a bit array in the Status List.
   Each Referenced Token is allocated an index during issuance that
   represents its position within this bit array.  The value of the
   bit(s) at this position correspond to the Referenced Token's status.
   The document also defines how an issuer of a Referenced Token
   references a Status List Token.  Status Lists may be composed for
   expressing a range of Status Types.  This document defines basic
   Status Types for the most common use cases as well as an
   extensibility mechanism for custom Status Types.  The Status List
   Token may be used by an issuer in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier model to
   express the status of verifiable credentials (Referenced Tokens)
   issued by an issuer.

   The following diagram depicts the basic conceptual relationship.

1.1.  Rationale

   Revocation mechanisms are an essential part for most identity
   ecosystems.  In the past, revocation of X.509 TLS certificates has
   been proven difficult.  Traditional certificate revocation lists
   (CRLs) have limited scalability; Online Certificate Status Protocol
   (OCSP) has additional privacy risks, since the client is leaking the
   requested website to a third party.  OCSP stapling is addressing some
   of these problems at the cost of less up-to-date data.  Modern
   approaches use accumulator-based revocation registries and Zero-
   Knowledge-Proofs to accommodate for this privacy gap, but face
   scalability issues again.

   This specification seeks to find a balance between scalability,
   security, and privacy by minimizing the status information to mere
   bits (often a single bit) and compressing the resulting binary data.
   Thereby, a Status List may contain statuses of 100,000 or more
   Referenced Tokens, but still remain relatively small.  Placing large
   amounts of Referenced Tokens into the same list also enables herd
   privacy relative to the Issuer.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   Status List:  A bit array that lists the statuses of many Referenced
      Tokens.

   Status List Token:  A token in JWT or CWT representation that
      contains a Status List.

   Referenced Token:  A token in JWT or CWT representation which
      contains a reference to a Status List Token.  The information from
      the contained Status List may give a verifier additional
      information about up-to-date status of the Referenced Token.

4.  JSON Web Token Representation

4.1.  Referenced Token Format and Processing Requirements

   The following rules apply to validating a Referenced Token in JWT
   representation, which references a Status List Token.  Application of
   additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the
   verifying party.

   1.  The JWT MUST contain an "iss" (issuer) claim that contains a
       unique string identifier for the entity that issued the JWT.  In
       the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
       compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the
       Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of
       [RFC3986].  The value MUST be equal to that of the "iss" claim
       contained within the referenced Status List Token.

   2.  The JWT MUST contain an "status" (status) claim conforming to the
       rules outlined in Section 4.1.1

   The following example is the decoded header and payload of a JWT
   meeting the processing rules as defined above.

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "kid": "11"
   }
   .
   {
     "iss": "https://example.com",
     "status": {
       "idx": 0,
       "uri": "https://example.com/statuslists/1"
     }
   }

4.1.1.  Status Claim Format

   The following rules apply to validating the "status" (status) claim

   1.  The claim value MUST be a valid JSON object.

   2.  The claim value object MUST contain an "idx" (index) member with
       a numeric value that represents the index to check for status
       information in the Status List for the current JWT.  The value of
       this member MUST be a non-negative number, containing a value of
       zero or greater.

   3.  The claim value object MUST contain a "uri" member with a string
       value that identifies the Status List containing the status
       information for the JWT.  The value of this member MUST be a uri
       conforming to [RFC3986].

4.2.  Status List JWT Format and Processing Requirements

   The following rules apply to validating a JWT-based Status List
   Token.  Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the
   discretion of the verifying party.

   1.  The JWT MUST contain an "iss" (issuer) claim that contains a
       unique string identifier for the entity that issued the JWT.  In
       the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise,
       compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the
       Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of
       [RFC3986].  The value MUST be equal to that of the "iss" claim
       contained within the Referenced Token.

   2.  The JWT MUST contain a "sub" (subject) claim that contains an
       unique string identifier for that Referenced Token.  The value
       MUST be equal to that of the "uri" claim contained in the
       "status" claim of the Referenced Token.

   3.  The JWT MUST contain an "iat" (issued at) claim that identifies
       the time at which it was issued.

   4.  The JWT MUST contain an "status_list" (status list) claim
       conforming to the rules outlined in Section 4.2.1.

   5.  The JWT MAY contain an "exp" (expiration time) claim that conveys
       when it is considered expired by its issuer.

   6.  The JWT MAY contain other claims.

   7.  The JWT MUST be digitally signed using an asymmetric
       cryptographic algorithm.  Relying parties MUST reject the JWT if
       it is using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm.
       Relying parties MUST reject JWTs with an invalid signature.

   8.  Relying parties MUST reject JWTs that are not valid in all other
       respects per "JSON Web Token (JWT)" [RFC7519].

     "typ": "statuslist+jwt",
     "alg": "ES256",
     "kid": "11"
   }

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com",
     "sub": "https://example.com/statuslists/1",
     "iat": 1683560915,
     "exp": 1686232115,
     "status_list": {
       "bits": 1,
       "lst": "H4sIAMo_jGQC_9u5GABc9QE7AgAAAA"
     }
   }

4.2.1.  Status List Claim Format

   The following rules apply to validating the "status_list" (status
   list) claim

   1.  The claim value MUST be a valid JSON object.

   2.  The claim value object MUST contain a "bits" (bit size) member
       with an numeric value that represents the number of bits per
       Referenced Token in the Status List ("lst") of the Status List
       JWT.  The allowed values for "bits" are 1,2,4 and 8.

   3.  The claim value object MUST contain a "lst" (list) member with a
       string value that represents the status values for all the tokens
       it conveys statuses for.  The value MUST be computed using the
       algorithm described in Section 4.2.2.

4.2.2.  Status List Encoding

   Each status of a Referenced Token MUST be represented with a bit size
   of 1,2,4, or 8.  Therefore up to 2,4,16, or 256 statuses for a
   Referenced Token are possible, depending on the bit size.  This
   limitation is intended to limit bit manipulation necessary to a
   single byte for every operation and thus keeping implementations
   simpler and less error prone.

   1.  The overall Status List is encoded as a byte array.  Depending on
       the bitsize, each byte corresponds to 8/(#bit-size) statuses
       (8,4,2, or 1).  The status of each Referenced Token is identified
       using the index that maps to one or more specific bits within the
       byte array.  The index starts counting at 0 and ends with "size"
       - 1 (being the last valid entry).  The bits within an array are
       counted from least significant bit "0" to the most significant
       bit ("7").  All bits of the byte array at a particular index are
       set to a status value.

   2.  The complete byte array is compressed using gZIP [RFC1952].

   3.  The result of the gZIP compression is then base64url-encoded, as
       defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

5.  Status Types

   This document defines potential statuses of Referenced Tokens as
   Status Type values.  If the Status List contains more than one bit
   per token (as defined by "bits" in the Status List), then the whole
   value of bits MUST describe one value.  A Status List can not
   represent multiple statuses per Referenced Token.

   The registry in this document describes the basic Status Type values
   required for the most common use cases.  Additional values may
   defined for particular use cases.

5.1.  Status Types Values

   A status describes the state, mode, condition or stage of an entity
   that is described by the status list.  Status Types MUST be numeric
   values between 0 and 255.  Status types described by this
   specification comprise: - 0x00 - "VALID" - The status of the Token is
   valid, correct or legal.  - 0x01 - "INVALID" - The status of the
   Token is revoked, annulled, taken back, recalled or cancelled.  This
   state is irreversible.  - 0x02 - "SUSPENDED" - The status of the
   Token is temporarily invalid, hanging, debarred from privilege.  This
   state is reversible.

   The issuer of the Status List Token MUST choose an adequate "bits"
   (bit size) to be able to describe the required Status Types for the
   application.

6.  Example JWT Status Lists

6.1.  Example Status List with 1-Bit Status Values

   In this example, the Status List is used as a revocation list.  It
   only requires the Status Types "VALID" and "INVALID"; therefore a
   "bits" of 1 is sufficient.

   This example Status List represents the statuses of 16 Referenced
   Tokens, requiring 16 bits (2 bytes) of status.

   status[0] = 1
   status[1] = 0
   status[2] = 0
   status[3] = 1
   status[4] = 1
   status[5] = 1
   status[6] = 0
   status[7] = 1
   status[8] = 1
   status[9] = 1
   status[10] = 0
   status[11] = 0
   status[12] = 0
   status[13] = 1
   status[14] = 0
   status[15] = 1

   These bits are concatenated:

   byte             0                  1               2
   bit       7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+...
   values   |1|0|1|1|1|0|0|1|  |1|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|  |0|...
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+...
   index     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   15   ...  10 9 8   23
            \_______________/  \_______________/
                   0xB9               0xA3

   Resulting in the byte array:

   byte_array = [0xB9, 0xA3]

   After compression and base64url encoding, the generated Status List
   is:

   "status_list": {
      "bits": 1,
      "lst": "H4sIAMo_jGQC_9u5GABc9QE7AgAAAA"
   }

6.2.  Example Status List with 2-Bit Status Values

   In thisexample, the Status List additionally includes the Status Type
   "SUSPENDED.  As the Status Type value for "SUSPENDED" is 0x02 and
   does not fit into 1 bit, the "bits" is required to be 2.

   This example Status List represents the status of 12 Referenced
   Tokens, requiring 24 bits (3 bytes) of status.

   status[0] = 1
   status[1] = 2
   status[2] = 0
   status[3] = 3
   status[4] = 0
   status[5] = 1
   status[6] = 0
   status[7] = 1
   status[8] = 1
   status[9] = 2
   status[10] = 3
   status[11] = 3

   These bits are concatenated:

   byte             0                  1                  2
   bit       7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   values   |1|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|  |0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|  |1|1|1|1|1|0|0|1|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
             \ / \ / \ / \ /    \ / \ / \ / \ /    \ / \ / \ / \ /
   status     3   0   2   1      1   0   1   0      3   3   2   1
   index      3   2   1   0      7   6   5   4      11  10  9   8
              \___________/      \___________/      \___________/
                   0xC9               0x44               0xF9

   Resulting in the byte array:

   byte_array = [0xC9, 0x44, 0xF9]

   After compression and base64url encoding, the generated Status List
   is:

   "status_list": {
      "bits": 2,
      "lst": "H4sIAMo_jGQC_zvp8hMAZLRLMQMAAAA"
   }

7.  CWT Representations

   TBD Define parallel CWT representations for Status Lists and
   Referenced Tokens.

   TBD Declare whether JWT and CWT representations can be used
   interchangeably by the same issuer.  For instance, declare whether a
   status list can reference both JWT and CWT tokens.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Correct decoding and parsing of the encoded status list

   TODO elaborate on risks of incorrect parsing/decoding leading to
   erroneous status data

8.2.  Cached and Stale status lists

   TODO consumers/Verifiers of the status list should be aware if they
   fetch the up-to-date data

8.3.  Authorized access to the Status List

   TODO elaborate on authorization mechanisms preventing misuse and
   profiling as described in privacy section

8.4.  History

   TODO elaborate on status list only providing the up-to date/latest
   status, no historical data, may be provided by the underlying hosting
   architecture

9.  Privacy Considerations

9.1.  Herd Privacy

   TODO elaborate on herd privacy, size of the status list

9.2.  Profiling

   TODO elaborate on Verifiers regularly fetching the status list to
   create a profile, possible countermeasures with authorized access to
   the status list

9.3.  Correlation Risks and Tracking

   TODO elaborate on Issuer-Verifier correlation and Verifier-Verifier
   correlation as the status list introduces unique,trackable data TODO
   elaborate on issuers avoiding sequential usage of indices and status
   lists TODO elaborate that a status list only gives information about
   the maximum number of possible statuses that a list conveys, issuers
   are recommended to pre-allocate lists, use dead entries that are
   never assigned or other obfuscation mechanisms

9.4.  Malicious Issuers

   TODO elaborate on issuers generating unique status lists per
   Referenced Token that do not offer herd privacy

9.5.  Hosting Service (what's a better name here?)

   TODO elaborate on increased privacy if the status list is hosted by a
   third party instead of the issuer reducing tracking possiblities TODO
   evaluate deifnition of Status List Provider?  An entity that hosts
   the Status List as a resource for potential verifiers.  The Status
   List Provider may be the issuer of the Status List but may also be
   outsourced to a trusted third party.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies no IANA actions.
